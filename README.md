Itâ€™s a web service made with React for frontend ,styled with bootstrap and express for backend built on Vite. Users are able to browse and filter through a catalog of products from their chosen market, Add these items to a cart for a shared order, pay for each item they added and checkout the order once each person has paid via the PayPal payment gateway. By sharing orders, expenses on deliveries are saved. The finalized app has been deployed via Github Pages.
